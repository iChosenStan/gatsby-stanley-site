So in your react components, all of your data is queried at build time from that same place, in the same way through GraphQL.","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":1,"offset":1582},"end":{"line":17,"column":418,"offset":1999}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":1,"offset":1582},"end":{"line":17,"column":418,"offset":1999}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The second reason it’s special is the richness of the Gatsby ecosystem.
